Diabetes Mellitus is a 500 year old term that describes the sweet-smelling urine
of people whose bodies have stopped being able to regulate blood sugar properly.

We now know that it refers to a family of different (and largely unrelated)
diseases that all have the same symptoms before doctors can determine what has
caused them. People -- even doctors -- still have trouble understanding the
differences between these diseases, so I tried to come up with a simple and
(hopefully) humerous analogy by thinking of each disease as a problem with your
car.

While it is possible to _biologically_ have more than one of the conditions
described below, the [current _medical_ classification
system](http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/42/Supplement_1/S13) and icd10
coding for diabetes mellitus only allows for recognition that a patient has one
kind of diabetes.

## Type 1

> Your washer fluid (something designed to make your car easier/safer to drive)
> is leaking onto the gas tank and causing it to rust and develop holes. It
> might take weeks or months, but you eventually won't be able to put anymore
> gas into your car unless you find a way to bypass the tank and get fuel into
> the lines through some other means (maybe a small tank that sits next to you
> on the passenger seat, with a hand pump you can squeeze to get fuel into the
> engine).
>
> For half of you, the mechanic thinks you're driving an SUV (even you aren't),
> doesn't bother to look at your gas tank, and just tells you to start adding
> fuel efficiency additives.

[Type 1 diabetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_1_diabetes) is an
autoimmune disease, caused when the body's own immune system destroys the cells
that produce insulin. It can come on fast (usually in kids) or slow (usually in
adults). While the exact causes are unknown, it is suspected that the disease is
"activated" in people with at-risk genes by some sort of environmental trigger
event (e.g. illness, stress, pregnancy).

Despite once being called Juvenile Diabetes, more than half of all new cases of
Type 1 are in adults. If misdiagnosis rates were to be corrected, that number
would climb to 75%. This means that half of people with Type 1 remain
misdiagnosed as Type 2.

## Type 1b (idiopathic)

> Your gas tank is rusting and quickly developing holes, but the mechanic hasn't
> figured out why it's happening.

The term
[idiopathic diabetes](https://www.healthcentral.com/article/idiopathic-diabetes)
has been used for decades to describe a condition that looks and acts like Type
1 (thus its classification as Type 1b), but the underlying cause cannot
immediately be identified. There is a strong suspicion that we have not yet
identified all of the kinds of autoantibodies associated with Type 1 (e.g. the
fairly recent discovery of
[ZnT8 autoantibodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_transporter_8)), but
there may also be other causes. Diagnosis of Type 1b is strongly associated with
people of African and Asian descent.

## Type 2

> You're driving an SUV. There are additives that you can add to your fuel to
> get better fuel efficiency, but they're usually expensive and work best with
> premium fuel. If you don't use these, your fuel efficiency will continue to
> get worse.
>
> Friends and strangers ridicule you for buying a gas-guzzling SUV, even though
> actually got it as a gift from your parents and can't afford a different car.
>
> 20% of you aren't actually driving an SUV, but your mechanic insists that you
> are, even if those fuel additives aren't working.

[Type 2 diabetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2) is a
metabolic disorder associated with a body's inability to use insulin
efficiently. Up to 1/3 of Americans have or are at risk of developing this
disease. No one knows what causes this disease, but genetics contribute
significantly to your risk. It is not caused by eating too much sugar or being
overweight, but these activities also significantly increase your risk.
Increased insulin resistance (whether from Type 2, PCOS, or metabolic syndrome)
has been known to cause weight gain. It can't be cured, but some people with
Type 2 are able to effectly keep the disease in remission through medication,
and careful control over diet and exercise.

Despite being the most common form of diabetes, it is also one of the least
understood. The official classification for Type 2 basically says that it is the
diabetes you have if you do _not_ have any other kind of diabetes.

Roughly 20% of people diagnosed as Type 2 are misdiagnosed and actually have
Type 1, Type 3c, or MODY.

## Type 3c

> You got rear-ended and your gas tank was damaged so it no longer holds fuel.
>
> It's like Type 1, but you also have to deal with all of the other problems
> caused by the collision.
>
> Almost all of you are told to just start putting efficiency additives and
> better fuel into your gas tank.

[Type 3c diabetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_3c_(Pancreatogenic)_Diabetes)
is caused when the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas are damaged by
another disease like pancreatitis or [cystic fibrosis](https://www.cff.org/Life-With-CF/Daily-Life/Cystic-Fibrosis-Related-Diabetes/).
It used to be considered secondary diabetes, but is so prevalent it now has its
own classification.

It is estimated that over 97% of people with Type 3c are currently misdiagnosed
as another kind of diabetes.

## Secondary diabetes

> It's like Type 3c but instead of being rear-ended, your mechanic accidentally
> poked a hole in your gas tank.

Secondary diabetes is caused by damage to the insulin-producing cells in the
pancreas by some external factor not specifically described by another type. The
most common form of secondary diabetes results from side effects to medications
like chemotherapy.

## MODY (maturity onset diabetes of the young)

> You're don't realize it but you're driving a Yugo, one of 11 specific kinds of
> car that just weren't built to run properly.
>
> It's **very** expensive and time consuming to run a check on your VIN and see
> if your car is one of the problematic models.
>
> Almost all of you are told to just start putting efficiency additives and
> better fuel into your gas tank.

There are [11 distinct forms of MODY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maturity_onset_diabetes_of_the_young),
each caused by a single gene. Different forms share symptoms with both Type 1
and Type 2. The only way to identify MODY is by family history and expensive
genetic testing.

This is thought to be very rare (less than 0.5% of all cases of diabetes), but
recent research suggests that 3-5% of people currently diagnosed as Type 2
actually have some form of MODY.

## Neonatal diabetes

> Your parents just bought you a brand new car for your 16th birthday. It's the
> same model of car they've been driving for years. For some reason, yours
> doesn't work right and needs fuel efficiency additives, or possibly even fuel
> injected manually into the engine. There is a very slim (&lt;1% chance) that
> the problems will go away over the next few years.

[Neonatal diabetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_diabetes_mellitus)
 is similar to MODY in that it is caused by a single gene, but is exclusively
 diagnosed in infants (usually under 6 months of age). It is almost always
 permanent but similar to some forms of MODY, can be effectively treated with
 certain oral medications.

## Mitochondrial diabetes

> Your mom bought you a new car. It likely has a hole in the gas tank, but might
> just need fuel additives for efficiency. The inside of the car is
> sound-proof.

This rare form of diabetes is also known as
[diabetes and deafness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_and_deafness),
and is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA (which you get from your
mother). Its symptoms are similar to Type 1, but as the name suggests it is also
accompanied by hearing loss.

## Gestational diabetes

> You're preparing for a birthday party and have filled your minivan so full of
> supplies and toys that it no longer runs very well. Some kid probably sprayed
> silly string into the gas tank. Another one might have bumped the washer fluid
> tank and started a leak.
>
> Things will probably be better after the celebration.

Gestational diabetes is a temporary form of diabetes that occurs in some
pregnant women. While this usually goes away after the child is born, pregnancy
is also one of the known trigger events in people at risk for Type 1, which can
come on immediately after the pregnancy, or years later. Doctors should, but
rarely test for the autoantibodies that would differentiate "regular"
gestational diabetes from
[autoimmune gestational daibetes](http://adultt1diabetes.blogspot.com/2015/05/autoimmune-gestational-diabetes.html)
that should be diagnosed as Type 1.

The following terms are also used to describe diabetes mellitus, but for one reason or another they

## Type 3

> Your car's GPS nagivation system keeps having you take wrong turns and getting
> lost. Some times it loses GPS signal and has no idea where you are. For some
> reason, this might somehow be related to your fuel efficiency.

[Type 3 diabetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_3_diabetes) was
[proposed in 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15750215) to describe a
form of Alzheimer's disease that is caused by insulin resistance within the
brain. Though multiple studies have since confirmed this to be true, it has not
yet been _officially_ recognized as its own form of diabetes mellitus.

Despite the similarity in their names, Type 3 has nothing to do with Type 3c.

## LADA (Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults)

> You have Type 1 but the holes in your gas tank develop slowly. Most of you are
> driving older cars.

[LADA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_autoimmune_diabetes_in_adults) is an
unofficial term [proposed in 1993](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8425674)
that pre-dates the official classification that all autoimmune diabetes mellitus
is Type 1 (1995).  It is currently used to differentiate the rapid-onset form of
the disease most often seen in young people from the slow-onset form most often
seen in adults.

There are a number of recognized problems with the current criteria used to
describe LADA, so doctors are currently [working to define](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6021307/)
what is different between LADA and "regular" Type 1. It may some day become its
own official type, but until then

## Double Diabetes

> You're driving a gas-guzzling SUV while your washer fluid tank is also leaking
> and causing your gas tank to rust and develop holes.

This unofficial term is used by some people to describe simultaneously having
autoimmune diabetes (Type 1) and severe insulin resistance (which might
otherwise be diagnosed as Type 2, or is caused by a different disorder like
[polycystic ovary syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome)).

Roughly half of people with Type 1 are overweight and have mild to severe
insulin resistance (about the same as the non-diabetic population).

Use of this term is discouraged in the medical community because it does not
accurately describe the underlying medical conditions.

## Type 1.5

> You have Type 1 but the holes in your gas tank develop slowly. Most of you are
> driving older cars.

**_Or_**

> You're driving a gas-guzzling SUV while your washer fluid tank is also leaking
> and causing your gas tank to rust and develop holes.

Type 1.5 was coined about 8 years before the LADA term was proposed, and
essentially describes the same condition in less detail.

Somehow over the years, the term has also started being used to describe a
completely separate condition: Type 1 with severe insulin resistance.

Use of this term is discouraged in the medical community because its two
unrelated definitions cause confusion and does not accurately describe either of
these two unrelated but complex conditions.

### Diabetes Insipidus

> Your engine actually works fine. You're driving some other kind of vehicle
> entirely, with its own unrelated problems.

In other words, [diabetes insipidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_insipidus)
is a completely unrelated disease that only shares the word "diabetes" in its
name because 500 years ago they were both diagnosed by looking at (and tasting)
people's urine. Diabetes Mellitus tastes/smells sweet like honey, Diabetes
Insipidus is weak and watery.
