The name "Diabetes Mellitus" dates back roughly 500 years, and as Melitta said the disease ("sugar sickness" among other terms) goes back a few thousand.  "Juvenile DM" and "Adult DM" were dropped in 1979 in favor of "insulin dependent DM" and "non-insulin dependent DM" because of the recognition that adults were also known to contract the disease.  And again in 1995, IDDM was renamed to "Type 1" (and NIDDM to "Type 2") with the recognition that people with Type 2 often became insulin dependent, and to differentiate the specific natures of the diseases (autoimmune vs metabolic), and allow for other types (MODY, Type 1B, etc) that were also classified at and after that time.

LADA was proposed in a paper in 1993 as a form of autoimmune DM that showed signs of insulin resistance.  At some point after that, "Type 1.5" which referred to someone with Type 1 and insulin resistance (aka "double diabetes", though both terms are discouraged among the medical community), became associated more with adult-onset than with juvenile-onset T1.  However, we now know that people with adult-onset and slow-onset T1 show roughly the same rates of insulin resistance as the general non-diabetic population (meaning, it has no statistically significant correlation with T1).  At this point, LADA means just what its name suggests -- a latent form of autoimmune diabetes.  This lines up well with the findings from Trialnet that show *most* people who develop T1 later in life will have developed autoantibodies by the time they turn 18 (this is recognized as "Stage 1 T1DM") but the disease sits latent for years/decades before progressing to Stage 2 and beyond (if it ever does).

Anyway, there *is* evidence that rate and age of onset are separate conditions within the overall classification of "Type 1 or Autoimmune DM", but this is *very* cutting edge research and at the moment leaves more open questions than answers.  E.g. a recent paper (http://www.exeter.ac.uk/research/newsandevents/news/title_606216_en.html) identified 3 genotypes strongly correlated to 3 distinct age ranges for onset.  However there are over 50 different genotypes associated with T1, so that's just a drop in the bucket.  

Autoimmune disorders are extremely complex -- I have friends with Celiac who explain that it's more like 1000 separate but related disorders because everyone reacts differently to different variations of gluten.  I suspect that T1 is the same way.
