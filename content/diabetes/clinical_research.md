Photos like this one are fairly common in Type 1 Diabetes forums, usually
accompanied by a comment like _"DKA sucks!"_, making light of the extremely
unpleasant and occasionally deadly [Diabetic
Ketoacidosis](https://www.sugarsurfing.com/single-post/2018/05/06/Diabetic-Ketoacidosis-myths-tips-and-lesser-known-facts).
I decided to post a similar photo but with a **positive** story behind it. So
this is me, sitting in a hospital bed in the research wing of a local hospital
while they spent several hours measuring how my body reacts when I drink a high
carb/protein shake and don't take insulin for it.

## Why participate in research?

When I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes, I had the chance to enroll in the
[Extend Study](http://www.extendstudy.org/), one of many studies looking into
the possibility that a particular immune suppressant can help slow down the
onset and progression of T1. The main part of the study is over for me, but I
enrolled in a long-term followup that will track the progression of my disease
as long as my body still produces a measurable amount of insulin. I also
contribute samples of my blood to a biorepository so that current and future
scientists can learn as much as possible about this disease in their search for
its cause, new treatments, and an eventual cure.

While the chance to slow down the progression of this disease certainly factored
into my choice to join this study, the more important fact is that participating
in research has been an extremely rewarding experience in so many other ways.
During the study, I had constant access to experts who have far more time to
keep up to date on the latest research and trends about my condition than my
regular doctors do. Additionally, many of the researchers and diabetic educators
also have type 1 diabetes, and were able to share a lot of personal experience
that was extremely helpful to someone like me who had been so recently
diagnosed. Seriously, joining a research study was by far the single most
helpful experience of my diagnosis.

All that aside, I just find the experience to be rewarding on a personal level.
It's actually quite difficult for research studies to find enough participants,
and this is one thing I can do to potentially help everyone else with this
disease.

## How do I participate?

The easiest way to participate is to let the researchers know that you want to help.
I've included some links here to a number of research registries I know about:

* https://www.benaroyaresearch.org/our-research/clinical-research/get-involved
  * https://www.benaroyaresearch.org/our-research/biorepositories
* http://www.jdrf.org/research/clinical-trials/
* https://www.findmecure.com/
* https://www.antidote.me/
* https://www.clarahealth.com/

P.S. You can help out even if you have a healthy immune system!  Research
facilities like Benaroya Institute are always looking for healthy volunteers to
provide samples for comparison to those of us with compromised immune systems.
You can get in touch with them here to register:

me via one if the links to the left.
