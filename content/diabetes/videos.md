Yup. Except that this "new purified extract" was actually the formulation from James Collip because Frederick Banting's version tested the day before didn't actually work (well, several weeks before, actually -- they tested it on a single patient first, and it wasn't until he recovered that they administered it to a large number of children). Banting and Best get all of the glory, but they (certainly not Banting) would likely never have arrived at a functioning stable extract without Collip -- please don't forget the man who made it possible
