This page is sort of a living document about my research into the naming history of autoimmune diabetes mellitus, more commonly known as Type 1 Diabetes.

There are obviously a lot of missing sections but I've been promising to get this posted for several years and I figure this is the best way to encourage myself to finish.

### Diabetes Mellitus

The name "Diabetes Mellitus" dates back roughly 500 years, and awarness of the disease by other names (e.g. "sugar sickness") goes back a few thousand.

Until I finish this section, you can [read more about Diabetes Mellitus at Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus).

### Juvenile and Adult Diabetes

TBD.

### Type 1 Diabetes

Though not officially approved for use until 1995 (more on that further down in the timeline), "Type 1 Diabetes" dates back to John Lister from 1951.

I'll eventually fill in this section, but for now you can read more about the early days of the Type 1 name on Diapedia:

* John Lister: https://www.diapedia.org/type-1-diabetes-mellitus/2104085134/historical-aspects-of-type-1-diabetes
* Andrew Cudworth, the man who popularized Lister's proposed names: https://www.diapedia.org/introduction-to-diabetes-mellitus/1104106110/andrew-cudworth


### Insulin Dependent Diabetes

TBD

### Type 1.5

The first appearance of the term "Type 1.5 diabetes" was published in an anonymous editorial in the medical journal [The Lancet in 1985<sup>1</sup>](#1), which finishes with the passage _"When diabetes is again reclassified we may find them accommodated in a new category of type 1 1/2; diabetes -- a condition in which insulin sustains not life itself but the quality of life."_

I haven't been able to determine how quickly use of this term spread to the medical community.  The only other significant reference I have been able to find from the time period is a [1988 article about classification of adults as IDDM<sup>2</sup>](#2), which merely references the original article as an example of why the diagnostic criteria of the day were not sufficient.

_Note: I am still looking for evidence for when this term became symonymous with "Double Diabetes" (or "Type 1 DM, with insulin resistance", as it is currently known)._ This interpretation seems to be part of the confusion that contributes to the current epidemic of misdiagnosis of Type 1 adults as Type 2.

### LADA: Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults

The term LADA was proposed by [Toumi, et. al. in 1993<sup>3</sup>](#3) to speak of the same condition, this time with more understanding of the autoimmune process behind the disease: autoimmune diabetes diagnosed in adulthood (which usually presents itself slowly and back then was thought to be treatable with medications intended for people with what was then called non-insulin dependent diabetes).  

_Note: Yes, I plan to add more details in this section..._

### Type 1 Diabetes

In 1995, the US caught up with the rest of the world (_Note: I'm still looking for references about the worldwide adoption of Type 1_) and consolidated all autoimmune diabetes under the "Type 1" name, relegating both "Type 1.5" and "LADA" as unofficial terms that people still want to use as a way to differentiate between childhood-onset and adult-onset T1, or rapid-onset (most commonly diagnosed in children) and slow-onset (most commonly diagnosed in adults).  Unfortunately, it's often difficult to figure out which they mean because some young people develop slow-onset T1, and some adults develop rapid-onset T1.

### Whats next?

TBD.  
* The current state of naming confusion and continued (mis?) use of T1.5 and LADA
* Genetic research showing possible differences between rapid- and slow-onset T1
* Any other ideas?

For now, check out this article from 2003:
