The Trossingen Lyre was uncovered in a 6th century gravesite in modern day
Germany, and represents the most complete Anglo-Saxon lyre found to date. After
making a prototype lyre out of plywood (links and more info for that coming
soon), I decided to try my hand at this more difficult project.

This is an **ongoing** project, so I will be updating this page as often as I can.

You can read more about the original lyre in the German Wikipedia article about the
[Trossingen Lyre](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trossinger_Leier)
([English translation](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fde.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FTrossinger_Leier)).

Thanks to the high resolution photos of the lyre from the wikipedia page linked
above, I was able to take very precise measurements of the Trossingen lyre
(verified against official archaeological descriptions as often as possible) and
translate them to one of my favorite CAD programs, with only a few minor
stylistic adjustments. I will eventually provide a PDF version of the template
that you can print and use for your own project, but in the mean time, you can
always view the most up to date version of all of
[my lyre designs at OnShape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/0dce389bcb220c183a675a43/w/9e9bb293705e739668b0b1d6/e/ccfc65f124cc78a3e873ac44)
(a web search will turn up how to get a free account, as well as their great
tutorials for using the app).

### Materials

* 6mm MDF for the cutting template
* 4/4 or 5/4 carbonized maple ([Cambia](https://cambiawood.com//about-our-wood/thermally-modified-wood) makes this by basically cooking the wood until it turns this amazing dark color and gains some more dimensional stability)
* 1/8" walnut from my lumber yard's scrap pile
* 1/8" spalted maple from a local tree
* 3/4 hard maple for the bridge, tuning pegs, and a couple of pins in the lyre body
* Fluorocarbon lyre strings from [Michael J King](https://www.michaeljking.com/lyre_shop.htm)

### Shaping

Due to a mixup in my designs, I actually purchased [8/4 wood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9TTb-QBGLo)
for the body, so my first task was to resaw this in half and get it smooth on my
thickness planer. I also did the same with some thicker pieces of walnut to get
them down to 1/8" (3mm) thick. This is somewhat of a happy accident because it
left me with enough wood to make two lyres (which is why you will occasionally
see duplicate pieces in the photos).

Starting near the top of the soundbox, the Trossingen lyre gets thinner toward
the tuning pegs. I used my bandsaw to resaw a narrow diagonal cut roughly to the
position it needed to be, and then shaved the rest down to a more precise
thickness with a hand plane. I've really grown to love working with a very sharp
hand plane, and the antique #5 you see in the photos below is one of my absolute
favorites -- just look at how it can take the rough sawn surface down to
something so smooth it doesn't even need to be sanded.

Using the template I created from my CAD drawings (I used my wife's laser cutter
to make this one, but a paper template would work just as well), I traced the
shape of the lyre onto my materials and cut everything out roughly on the
bandsaw and then did a small amount of smoothing on the main boduy ith the
spokeshave just to knock down the most annoying of the saw marks.

### The Soundbox

Using my drill press and forstner bits of various sizes, I drilled out as much
of the soundbox as I could, down to about 3mm thick below the deepest cut from
the drill bits. I haven't yet modified a set of cheap forstner bits to
completely flatten the cutting surface, so my next task was to remove all of the
remaining wood by hand with chisels. This takes a long time, and was especially
nerve wracking as the wood got continuously thinner, but it really helps to keep
the strop near by and re-hone your chisels every couple of minutes so they
always have a razor edge.  I actually had the most trouble shaping the sides of
the walls -- the grain of the carbonized maple is somewhat crumbly and I
accidentally made a couple of small gouges where the grain wasn't completely
smooth (made especially difficult because I don't have carving knives or gouges,
just straight chisels). Once I got everything down to a consistent thickness, I
went over the whole thing several times with card scrapers and sand paper to get
the entire soundbox as smooth as possible for the best sound transmission.

Finally, I masked off surfaces that would eventually get glue, and painted both
parts of the soundbox with shellac. I really like shellac as a finish, but this
is mostly to seal up the grain for even better sound transmission, and provide a
small amount of protection from moisture just in case some water were to somehow
get inside (I do intend to play this outdoors while camping).  The darkness of
the maple here is amazing, so I added a quick coat to the top of the walnut just
for comparison (even though most of this will get planed away during the final
shaping).

And finally for this phase, I glued everything up.  I didn't quite have enough
clamps to glue both of the top pieces at the same time, so this happened in two
phases. I think I would probably do things again this way next time because it
was a lot easier to line up the spalted maple piece having the already-glued
walnut to brace it against.
