The Trossingen Lyre was uncovered in a 6th century gravesite in modern day
Germany, and represents the most complete Anglo-Saxon lyre found to date. After
making a prototype lyre out of plywood (links and more info for that coming
soon), I decided to try my hand at this more difficult project.

This is an **ongoing** project, so I will be updating this page as often as I can.

You can read more about the original lyre in the German Wikipedia article about the
[Trossingen Lyre](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trossinger_Leier)
([English translation](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fde.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FTrossinger_Leier)).

Thanks to the high resolution photos of the lyre from the wikipedia page linked
above, I was able to take very precise measurements of the Trossingen lyre
(verified against official archaeological descriptions as often as possible) and
translate them to one of my favorite CAD programs, with only a few minor
stylistic adjustments. I will eventually provide a PDF version of the template
that you can print and use for your own project, but in the mean time, you can
always view the most up to date version of all of
[my lyre designs at OnShape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/0dce389bcb220c183a675a43/w/9e9bb293705e739668b0b1d6/e/ccfc65f124cc78a3e873ac44)

tutorials for using the app).

### Materials

* 6mm MDF for the cutting template
* 4/4 or 5/4 carbonized maple ([Cambia](https://cambiawood.com//about-our-wood/thermally-modified-wood) makes this by basically cooking the wood until it turns this amazing dark color and gains some more dimensional stability)
* 1/8" walnut from my lumber yard's scrap pile
* 1/8" spalted maple from a local tree
* 3/4 hard maple for the bridge, tuning pegs, and a couple of pins in the lyre body
* Fluorocarbon lyre strings from [Michael J King](https://www.michaeljking.com/lyre_shop.htm)

### Shaping

Due to a mixup in my designs, I actually purchased [8/4 wood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9TTb-QBGLo)
for the body, so my first task was to resaw this in half and get it smooth on my
thickness planer. I also did the same with some thicker pieces of walnut to get
them down to 1/8" (3mm) thick. This is somewhat of a happy accident because it
left me with enough wood to make two lyres (which is why you will occasionally
see duplicate pieces in the photos).

Starting near the top of the soundbox, the Trossingen lyre gets thinner toward
the tuning pegs. I used my bandsaw to resaw a narrow diagonal cut roughly to the
position it needed to be, and then shaved the rest down to a more precise
thickness with a hand plane. I've really grown to love working with a very sharp
hand plane, and the antique #5 you see in the photos below is one of my absolute
favorites -- just look at how it can take the rough sawn surface down to
something so smooth it doesn't even need to be sanded.

Using the template I created from my CAD drawings (I used my wife's laser cutter
to make this one, but a paper template would work just as well), I traced the
shape of the lyre onto my materials and cut everything out roughly on the
bandsaw and then did a small amount of smoothing on the main boduy ith the
spokeshave just to knock down the most annoying of the saw marks.

### The Soundbox

Using my drill press and forstner bits of various sizes, I drilled out as much
of the soundbox as I could, down to about 3mm thick below the deepest cut from
the drill bits. I haven't yet modified a set of cheap forstner bits to
completely flatten the cutting surface, so my next task was to remove all of the
remaining wood by hand with chisels. This takes a long time, and was especially
nerve wracking as the wood got continuously thinner, but it really helps to keep
the strop near by and re-hone your chisels every couple of minutes so they
always have a razor edge.  I actually had the most trouble shaping the sides of
the walls -- the grain of the carbonized maple is somewhat crumbly and I
accidentally made a couple of small gouges where the grain wasn't completely
smooth (made especially difficult because I don't have carving knives or gouges,
just straight chisels). Once I got everything down to a consistent thickness, I
went over the whole thing several times with card scrapers and sand paper to get
the entire soundbox as smooth as possible for the best sound transmission.

Finally, I masked off surfaces that would eventually get glue, and painted both
parts of the soundbox with shellac. I really like shellac as a finish, but this
is mostly to seal up the grain for even better sound transmission, and provide a
small amount of protection from moisture just in case some water were to somehow
get inside (I do intend to play this outdoors while camping).  The darkness of
the maple here is amazing, so I added a quick coat to the top of the walnut just
for comparison (even though most of this will get planed away during the final
shaping).

And finally for this phase, I glued everything up.  I didn't quite have enough
clamps to glue both of the top pieces at the same time, so this happened in two
phases. I think I would probably do things again this way next time because it
was a lot easier to line up the spalted maple piece having the already-glued
walnut to brace it against.

### Final Shaping

The first step to the final shaping was to cut out the interior hole where the
player's hand will go. I'm terrible with a coping saw, and this might be the
thing that gets me to upgrade to a true fretsaw. Rather than accidentally cut
too close to my line, I gave up on accuracy and just left myself a bunch of
extra wood to remove with a spokeshave (when would fit) and spindle sander. I
can definitely see how lyres made with the crossbar as a separate piece would be
a lot easier to deal with, since it would allow a regular saw to get most of the
way down both sides of the arms and produce a much straighter cut.

This is also the step where I made my biggest mistake.  The Trossingen lyre has
two dowel pins at the top and bottom of the soundbox, and I decided to use
tapered maple pins (cast-offs from my tuning peg experiments) instead of dowels,
which would have been from a different kind of wood.  While pounding in one of
the pins, I hit it ever so slightly too hard and managed to leave a hairline
split in the back of the soundbox.  Thankfully, it was easily fixed with a bit
of glue and sawdust (and the glue holding in the pin itself should prevent
further splitting), but it was a loud reminder how fragile some of this wood can
be. It's also worth noting that the bottom pin on the actual lyre actually
protrudes and sits proud of the soundboard by about 1cm -- I chose to cut both
of my pins flush to the soundboard because I'm not actually sure how the
protruding lower pin would be used.

After sanding everything close to my marks, I moved on to hand shaping
everything, which was probably the trickiest step after hollowing out the
soundbox. Some of this was due to my lack of experience shaping things with
rasps and files, as well as a bit of fighting with the grain in walnut
soundboard, but mostly it was just that I couldn't get my tools where I wanted
them to be.  My spokeshave is too big to get into the corners of the interior
hole (makes me really curious about the Millers Falls "cigar" spokeshave), and
my workbench just isn't set up right to hold the entire lyre in place to run a
plane or spokeshave down the entire length of the instrument in order to
start/finish a shave cleanly. In the end, I just took my time with this and
switched between all of my tools as it felt appropriate. There was more than a
little joy watching and feeling the shape of the instrument come together
throughout this process and it was difficult to get myself to admit that it
really was done enough to continue on to the next step.

### Finish

Finishing the main lyre body is pretty straightforward.  I pondered using boiled
linseed oil, but didn't have any on hand and happen to really like the look of
clear shellac.

I thinned the canned shellac 1:1 with denatured alcohol and wiped on two thin
coats to get as much wood penetration as I could. After letting that dry for
about 5 minutes, I wiped on a full-strength coat and let it dry.

I let this dry overnight and then went over the whole thing again with 400 grit
sandpaper (I was planning to use steel wool, but I couldn't find any), wiped the
dust off with a dry cloth, and then added 2 more coats of shellac, this time
from a spray can. The final result is a perfectly smooth finish that really
shows off the character of the wood.

### Tuning Pegs

I've been working through how to make these, and have learned a lot (meaning,
I've made a bunch of mistakes).  I'd like to document all of this (including my
unorthodox tools), so this will get its own writeup.

### Tailpiece and Bridge

I'm sticking with the "inverted" theme and chose to make the tailpiece and
bridge out of hard maple so its lighter color will contrast with the rest of the
instrument. While a number of people use a simple dowel for the tailpiece, I
decided to try out a slightly more complex shape. It will be attached with some
goatskin rawhide lace, which was soaked in water, twisted, and then tied off to
dry with just a bit of tension to keep it in place. We'll see how it holds up.

Still haven't started on the bridge.  As with my prototype, I will do the main
shaping with a spindle sander, and then finish it by hand with files and
sandpaper.
