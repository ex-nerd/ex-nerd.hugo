Hi, you've found my "full" resume (i.e. curriculum vitae). It isn't tailored for any specific job application, and contains a very wide sampling of skills and experience (often not specifically related to my chosen profession in technology).  I mostly use it as a conversation starter before providing a more concise/professional PDF version.

This is always my most up-to-date resume — if you ask me for an updated version, I will just send you this URL.

If you have my phone number on file, please do not call it. I don't answer unknown numbers and you are much more likely to receive a reply by sending job details to me via email. I check my email regularly and will reply quickly if I'm interested.

<!-- However, I am not looking for employment at the moment. I am happily employed in a job that I enjoy. That doesn't mean that I'm not open to considering other opportunities, but it does mean that I have no interest in contract positions, anything outside of the Seattle area, or anything that pays less than what I currently make (so please provide salary ranges if you decide to contact me). -->

Please feel free to check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/exnerd), which I also keep up to date.

## TLDR

In my career as a software engineer/architect, I have worked extensively with
most of the popular technology stacks in use over the last 25+ years and
dabbled with most of the others. I love designing APIs that are intuitive for
other developers to use and understand, and systems that operate efficiently
and are easy for future generations of developers to maintain.

## COMPUTER SKILLS AND BUZZWORDS

- **Software development**:  I have most recently used Python/cython, Go, Java,
  and UNIX shell scripting. Comfortable but rusty with Perl, Ruby/Rails, PHP,
  C#/.NET, and Javascript. Reading knowledge of Objective C, C, and C++.
- **Database design**:  Considerable knowledge of design, administration, and
  performance tuning of MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. I also have experience
  with NoSQL, graph, and document-based systems like ArangoDB, ElasticSearch
  (lucene), Memcached, Redis, and Solr.
- **Infrastructure as code**: Automated infrastructure using tools like
  Ansible, Terraform, Chef, and AWS CloudFormation.
- **Cloud Services**: Extensive experience using and administering AWS services
  like IAM, EC2, S3, Mechanical Turk, and more (they keep adding things!), but
  I have also worked with Google Cloud services and APIs, and to a lesser
  extent with Digital Ocean, Azure, and Rackspace.
- **Project management**:  I am a strong believer in Stanford Design Thinking
  and identifying/solving the underlying problem rather than what the user
  perceives the problem to be. I have also been a Certified Scrum Master
  (renewal lapsed<!-- #111943 -->), and have experience with a variety of
  other agile practices.
- **Web design**:  Though I prefer to focus on the back-end side of things, I
  started my career as a full stack web developer. When needed, I can hold my
  own when it comes to modern HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and I have a great
  deal of experience with SEO (search engine optimization) and web-based user
  interface design.
- Expert knowledge of [RTFM and STFW](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STFW).

    development, and easy learning curve for future engineers.
