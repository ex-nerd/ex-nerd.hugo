## Who am I?

My name is Chris Petersen.

I graduated from the stereotypical social awkwardness a long time ago and now focus my attention on things that a lot of us recovering nerds enjoy:  family, food, friends, beer, and a little smattering of technology (I can’t stray too far from my roots).  That said, I’m still a total geek, in both the old nerdy definition as well as the newer "cool" meaning.

Though I primarily use this site for behind-the-scenes software development, in the spirit of what the web was designed for, I've chosen to share a part of my life with anyone out there who is mildly interested in reading about it.

I have a full time job and a great life away from this computer so I don't really update much of this site very often. However, that doesn't mean you shouldn't check back occasionally to see (or just use the RSS feed). And by all means feel free to drop me a line.

Welcome to my world.  It’s really not that bad of a place, actually.

## Contact

If the links in the sidebar aren't enough for you to find a way to get in touch with me, you can send an email to `geek` at this domain and it'll find its way to my inbox.

And if you have something interesting to say (and to those recruiters out there, that doesn't include "a job you might be interested in"), I might even reply.
