## Who am I?

Welcome to my world.  It’s really not that bad of a place, actually.  My name is Chris Petersen and I’m proud to admit that I’m a bit of a nerd.

I graduated from the stereotypical social awkwardness a long time ago and now focus my attention on things that a lot of us 30-something recovering nerds enjoy:  family, food, friends, beer, and a little smattering of technology (I can’t stray too far from my roots).  That said, I’m still a total geek, in both the old nerdy definition as well as the newer "cool" meaning.

## Contact

If the links in the sidebar aren't enough for you to find a way to get in touch with me, you can send an email to `geek` at this domain and it'll find its way to my inbox.

And if you have something interesting to say (and to those recruiters out there, that doesn't include "a job you might be interested in"), I might even reply.
