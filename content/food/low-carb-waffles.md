Something here about waffles.  And diabetes.

This makes 1 waffle so I would recommend at least doubling the recipe just to
get enough volume in the bowl to mix properly.

<hr style="width: 50%" />

Stir together the dry ingredients until they're evenly incorporated:

* 1/4 cup almond flour
* 1 tsbp vital wheat gluten
* 1/4 tsp baking powder
* pinch of salt
* 1 tsp cinnamon (or more, optional)

Mix in:

* 1 egg
* 1/4 cup Califia Farms unsweetened almond milk

Let sit 3-4 minutes to allow the gluten and cinnamon to hydrate.

Cook according to waffle maker directions.


Can also use this for pancakes if you double the recipe, add a bit more liquid and another 1/8 tsp baking powder.

You can find the almond milk at places like Whole Foods. More info from [Califia Farms](http://www.califiafarms.com/products/almondmilk/unsweetened)

I basically count these as 5g net carbs. The almost flour is 6g/3g per 1/4 cup but at 50% fiber I've been counting it as 4g net. Everything else is under 1g net for the amounts used in the recipe.
