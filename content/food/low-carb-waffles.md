Living with [Type 1 Diabetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_autoimmune_diabetes_of_adults) means that I have to closely watch my carbohydrate intake, and it's easier to do this by eating low-carb foods.  Since I don't want to give up on some of the finer things in life -- like waffles -- I spent some time formulating a decent substitute for carb-heavy grain-based waffles.  This lets me have a fairly large breakfast of applesauce, yogurt, and definitely-not-maple (but passable) syrup and still keep things under 45g of carbs.

Keep in mind that this recipe is **not** gluten-free.  Gluten-free flours that provide the proper texture are still high in carbs, so I've chosen to add gluten to the almond flour in this recipe in order to get the proper stretchy and crunchy texture.

This recipe is made to be scaled up (it only makes 1 waffle in my machine).  Being so small, I would recommend at least doubling (if not tripling) just to get enough volume in the bowl to mix properly.

Stir together the dry ingredients until they're evenly incorporated:

* 1/4 cup almond flour
* 1 tsbp vital wheat gluten
* 1/4 tsp baking powder
* pinch of salt
* 1 tsp cinnamon (or more, optional)

Thoroughly mix in:

* 1 egg
* 1/4 cup [Califia Farms unsweetened almond milk](http://www.califiafarms.com/products/almondmilk/unsweetened)

Let sit 3-4 minutes to allow the gluten and cinnamon to hydrate.

Cook according to waffle maker directions.

**Notes:**

* _This recipe also works great for pancakes if you add a bit more liquid, and another 1/8 tsp baking powder (I usually triple it and round up to 1/2 tsp baking powder)._
* I buy the almond milk at Whole Foods but have seen it in other stores.  The unsweetened variety is basically 0g net carbs.  More info from [Califia Farms](http://www.califiafarms.com/products/almondmilk/unsweetened).
* I count this recipe as 5g net carbs. The almond flour I use is 6g per 1/4 cup but at 50% fiber I count it as 4g net. Everything else is under 1g net for the amounts used in the recipe, and I round up just to be safe.
