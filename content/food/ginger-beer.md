I like spicy ginger beer but over the years I've seen the best and spiciest varieties disappear from the market.  Always in search of a way to do things myself, here is the recipe I came up with.

<!--more-->

* 1/2 cup ginger juice
* 1/3 cup galangal ginger juice (see instructions below)
* 1/2 cup ground sugar (sugar + blender, for better dissolving in cold liquid)
* 1/4 cup lemon juice
* 1/4 cup honey
* 6   cup water

Note: Use "greater galangal" (aka thai ginger).  To prepare galangal ginger juice, mix root with water in at least a 2:1 weight ratio (meaning 2 lbs of root to 1 lb water), blend then strain well, squeezing out all of the liquid using a tea towel or other strong non-absorbent fabric.  I do the same with normal ginger but without the added water.

mix, carbonate.  Makes approx 2 litres.

(one of the little ice cubes == 1/24 cup)


--------------------------------------

for 5 gallons:

* 12-15 oz ginger
* 1 cup brown sugar
* 8-9 cups sugar

thinly slice the ginger and put into a pot with sugar and 1-2 gallons of
water..  boil this gently for a LONG time (1+ hours), stirring
occasionally.

right before you pour this into the keg to mix with more water, add:

3 tbsp lemon juice (just shy of 1/4 cup)

and that's it.  :)


--------------------------------------

*  tsp ginger juice (or more?)
* 1/8 cup (2 tbsp) simple syrup
* 1/2 cup water

mix (triple recipe for a good glass), cool, carbonate.

for a little over a half gallon:

* 1/2 cup ginger juice
* 2 cups  simple syrup (maybe slightly less)
* 8 cups  water

this is about 1.5x more ginger than in the smaller recipe, but I personally
think it will taste much better.
