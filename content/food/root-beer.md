Sassafras is the "root" in root beer. However, in the mid-60's, the FDA
discovered that a chemical in sassafras called
[safrole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safrole) caused cancer in rats, and
proceded to ban its sale for edible uses. This sent the root beer industry into
a frenzy trying to find a replacement flavor (they eventually came up with
something that's a combination of licorice root -- that's __not__ anise, and
doesn't taste like it -- and wintergreen).

<!-- more -->

Many people (myself included) believe that safrole is only dangerous when
extracted from the sassafras root itself (there is a common theory is in herbal
medicine that there are other chemicals present in the plant that cancel out the
harmful effects of things like safrole).  Thus, I don't mind drinking a little
"real" root beer -- if it does happen to be harmful, the small amounts that I
drink won't be that bad for me (couldn't be worse than something like alcohol).

After scouring books and the web for a good traditional root beer recipe, and
failing to come up with something really good, I eventually merged several
recipes together to come up with the following, which has a lot of the taste of
a traditional root beer, but also includes some wintergreen to make it more
compatible with the modern palate.

First, put about 5 quarts of water into your favorite brew pot, and then add:

* 1 oz sarsparilla root
* 1 oz sassafras root bark<sup>[1](#sassafras)</sup>
* 1 oz cherry bark
* 1/2 oz licorice root
* 1/2 tsp freshly ground nutmeg
* 1/8 oz cinnamon (about half a stick)<sup>[2](#cinnamon)</sup>
* 2 to 4 oz raisins (you can add more if you like their flavor)
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 3 cups honey
* 1/2 cup molasses
* 4 lb sugar

Simmer this mixture for an hour or so, until you have a 5 quarts or so of syrup
left in your pot (remember, adding all that stuff increased your volume by a
couple of quarts).

Once this is boiled down, strain your mixture into another pot and add:

* 1 tbsp vanilla extract
* 1 tsp wintergreen or birch extract, or 1/2 tsp pure essential oil
  <sup>[3](#wintergreen)</sup>

Stir a bit, and then bottle in 1-quart jars.  Due to the high sugar content,
this should keep fairly well, but you could always use a plastic jar or bottle
and store it in the freezer (do __not__ put glass into the freezer).  To make
the root beer, just mix 1:4 with water (one part syrup + 4 parts water) and
carbonate<sup>[4](#carbonate)</sup>.  Depending on your taste preference,
variations in cooking times, and/or the spices you used, you may find that the
ratio needs to be adjusted for your batch, so don't hesitate to use more or less
syrup to get the flavor just right.

<sup><a name="sassafras">1</a></sup>
Sassafras root bark (not plain old bark) is illegal for sale as a food product
in the US because it's been shown, like many things, to cause cancer in lab
rats. However, many brew stores carry the Brewer's Garden brand of sassafras
"potpouri", or you can get it directly from one of several bulk herb suppliers
online.  Please see [this article](http://www.chow.com/stories/10129) for a more
in depth explanation about the ban.

<sup><a name="cinnamon">2</a></sup>
What you buy in stores is actually cassia, not cinnamon.  If you can't get ahold
of "true" cinnamon, you might want to use a smaller amount than the one listed
in the recipe.  However, "true" cinnamon can usually be found in the Mexican
section of the grocery store as "canela".

<sup><a name="wintergreen">3</a></sup>
I initially tried wintergreen oil, but it doesn't dissolve well. I did
eventually find a good all-natural wintergreen extract (made by Boyajian) at a
local fruit market, though you'll also have luck buying it from cake-decorating
supply places (as it was a frosting-flavor additive).  Since then, I've learned
that you can use gum arabic as an emulsifier to allow the oil and sugar solution
to stay mixed.  Just mix the oil with a tsp or so of gum arabic, and then add a
tbsp or two of water as you quickly stir.  Once this is mixed, you can just add
it to the recipe like you would an extract.

__VERY Important__:  If you use essential oil, make sure that you are using
__food grade__ ingredients.  This means that you want 100% pure essential oil
and food grade gum arabic (do __not__ get it from an art supply store). There
are many herb and health food shops online that sell both ingredients.

<sup><a name="carbonate">4</a></sup>
If you don't want to spend the money on a carbon dioxide tank and injection
system, you can "cheat" and just mix the syrup straight into carbonated water
from a can or bottle.  If you do this, compare the different flavors of plain
carbonated versus "soda water" or "club soda".  The latter two usually have
baking soda added to counteract the mild acid generated during the carbonation
process, which some people think gives carbonated water an unpleasant tart
flavor (but which contributes to the flavor of many carbonated beverages).
